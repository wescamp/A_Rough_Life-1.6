His captors came to the conclusion that merely picking away at a stray beast here or there would hardly make the desert any safer in the long run. So, it was decided to strike at the heart of the beast horde. Or, rather, the two hearts."

			story= _ "For, while they couldn't furnish him with clearer information, the captors told him that much: there were two beasts that pushed and ruled their kind. Strike at them and the beast menace might disappear. Such, accordingly, were Jacques' orders - kill them both or perish trying."
