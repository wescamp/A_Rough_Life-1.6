description= _ "You are a young thief dreaming of greatness. Will it befall you, or will you fall looking for it?

(This is a medium-length campaign with 15 scenarios (14 complete), some of them only conversation. Note: This is a story-driven campaign where both maps and battles may warrant further improvements - any advice welcome via the forum.)

(Version 0.9.5, one last scenario missing but further balancing very likely needed, bugs possible.)"
